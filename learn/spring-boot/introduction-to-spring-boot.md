# Introduction to Spring Boot
---
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can **just run**.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
```

## Feature
- Create stand-alone Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
